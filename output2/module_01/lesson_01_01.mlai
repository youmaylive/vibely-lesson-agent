  <H1>Dynamical Systems Framework for Neuroscience</H1>

  <Body>Neuronal behavior can be precisely characterized as trajectories in state space, where understanding attractors and basins reveals how neurons respond to stimuli and return to rest. This lesson establishes the mathematical foundation that underlies all subsequent neuronal modeling in this course.</Body>

  <H2>What is a Dynamical System?</H2>

  <Body>A dynamical system is a mathematical framework that describes how the state of a system evolves over time according to fixed rules. In the context of neuroscience, dynamical systems provide the language to describe how membrane potentials, ion channel states, and other neuronal variables change moment by moment.</Body>

  <Body>Formally, a continuous-time dynamical system is defined by an ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form:</Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
dx/dt = f(x, t)
  </Code>

  <Body>Here, x represents the state vector (which could include membrane voltage, gating variables, calcium concentrations, etc.), t is time, and f is a function that specifies the instantaneous rate of change of the state. The function f encapsulates all the biophysical rules governing the system.</Body>

  <Body>When f does not depend explicitly on time (only on x), we call the system autonomous:</Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
dx/dt = f(x)
  </Code>

  <Body>Autonomous systems are particularly important in neuroscience because they capture intrinsic neuronal dynamics independent of time-varying external inputs.</Body>

    <Back>A system described by dx/dt = f(x, t), where x is the state vector and f specifies how the state evolves over time according to fixed rules.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>State Space and Trajectories</H2>

  <Body>The state space (or phase space) is the set of all possible states a system can occupy. Each dimension of the state space corresponds to one state variable. For a neuron described by its membrane voltage V alone, the state space is one-dimensional (the real line). For the Hodgkin-Huxley model with voltage V and three gating variables m, h, n, the state space is four-dimensional.</Body>

  <Body>A trajectory (or orbit) is the path traced out in state space as time progresses from some initial condition x(0) = x_0. Mathematically, a trajectory is the solution x(t) to the differential equation with specified initial conditions.</Body>

  <Code lang="python">
import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import odeint
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Simple 1D linear system: dV/dt = -(V - V_rest) / tau
def membrane_dynamics(V, t, V_rest, tau):
    return -(V - V_rest) / tau

# Parameters
V_rest = -70  # mV (resting potential)
tau = 10      # ms (membrane time constant)

# Simulate trajectories from different initial conditions
t = np.linspace(0, 50, 500)
initial_conditions = [-90, -80, -60, -50, -40]

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
for V0 in initial_conditions:
    V = odeint(membrane_dynamics, V0, t, args=(V_rest, tau))
    plt.plot(t, V, label=f'V(0) = {V0} mV')

plt.axhline(y=V_rest, color='k', linestyle='--', label='V_rest')
plt.xlabel('Time (ms)')
plt.ylabel('Membrane Voltage (mV)')
plt.title('Trajectories Converging to Resting Potential')
plt.legend()
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
  </Code>

  <Body>The code above demonstrates trajectories in a one-dimensional state space. Regardless of initial condition, all trajectories converge to the resting potential V_rest. This convergence behavior is the hallmark of a stable attractor.</Body>

  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Deterministic vs. Stochastic Dynamical Systems</H2>

  <Body>Deterministic dynamical systems follow exact, repeatable rules: given the same initial condition, the system always follows the same trajectory. The ODE dx/dt = f(x) is deterministic because f uniquely specifies the future evolution.</Body>

  <Body>Stochastic dynamical systems incorporate randomness, typically modeled as noise terms. A stochastic differential equation (SDE) takes the form:</Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
dx = f(x)dt + g(x)dW
  </Code>

  <Body>Here, dW represents a Wiener process (Brownian motion), and g(x) scales the noise intensity. In neurons, stochasticity arises from channel noise (random opening/closing of ion channels), synaptic noise (random neurotransmitter release), and thermal fluctuations.</Body>

  <Body>When does noise matter? The answer depends on the relationship between noise magnitude and the system's deterministic dynamics:</Body>

  <Body>1. Near bifurcation points (transitions between qualitative behaviors), even small noise can trigger large effects.</Body>

  <Body>2. In systems with multiple attractors, noise can cause switching between states.</Body>

  <Body>3. For neurons near firing threshold, channel noise can determine whether a spike occurs.</Body>

  <Body>4. In coherence resonance, intermediate noise levels actually regularize firing patterns.</Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc-deterministic-stochastic">
    <Front>What distinguishes deterministic from stochastic dynamical systems?</Front>
    <Back>Deterministic systems follow exact rules (dx/dt = f(x)) with repeatable trajectories. Stochastic systems include random noise (dx = f(x)dt + g(x)dW), making trajectories probabilistic.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Attractors: Where Dynamics Settle</H2>

  <Body>An attractor is a set of states toward which nearby trajectories converge as time approaches infinity. Attractors represent the long-term behavior of a dynamical system and are fundamental to understanding neuronal dynamics.</Body>

  <H3>Types of Attractors</H3>

  <Body>FIXED POINT ATTRACTOR: A single point in state space where the system remains stationary. Mathematically, x* is a fixed point if f(x*) = 0. A fixed point is attracting if nearby trajectories converge to it. The resting potential of a neuron is a classic example of a stable fixed point attractor.</Body>

  <Body>LIMIT CYCLE ATTRACTOR: A closed periodic orbit in state space. Trajectories nearby spiral toward the cycle and then follow it indefinitely. Rhythmic firing patterns, pacemaker neurons, and neural oscillations correspond to limit cycle attractors.</Body>

  <Body>STRANGE ATTRACTOR: A fractal set with chaotic dynamics. Trajectories on a strange attractor are sensitive to initial conditions (nearby trajectories diverge exponentially) yet remain bounded. Strange attractors may appear in networks of neurons and potentially in certain irregular firing patterns.</Body>

  <Code lang="python">
# Analytical solution for 1D linear system
# dV/dt = -(V - V_rest) / tau
# Solution: V(t) = V_rest + (V_0 - V_rest) * exp(-t/tau)

import numpy as np

def analytical_solution(t, V0, V_rest, tau):
    """
    Analytical solution for passive membrane equation.
    Shows exponential convergence to fixed point V_rest.
    """
    return V_rest + (V0 - V_rest) * np.exp(-t / tau)

# Verify convergence to fixed point
t = np.linspace(0, 50, 100)
V0 = -50  # Initial condition away from rest
V_rest = -70
tau = 10

V_trajectory = analytical_solution(t, V0, V_rest, tau)
# As t -&gt; infinity, V(t) -&gt; V_rest (the fixed point attractor)
  </Code>

  <FlashCard id="fc-attractor-types">
    <Front>Name three types of attractors in dynamical systems.</Front>
    <Back>1) Fixed point: single stationary state (e.g., resting potential). 2) Limit cycle: closed periodic orbit (e.g., rhythmic firing). 3) Strange attractor: fractal set with chaotic dynamics and sensitive dependence on initial conditions.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Finding Fixed Points</H2>

  <Body>To find fixed points, we solve f(x*) = 0. For the passive membrane equation dV/dt = -(V - V_rest)/tau, setting the right-hand side to zero gives:</Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
-(V* - V_rest) / tau = 0
V* - V_rest = 0
V* = V_rest
  </Code>

  <Body>The resting potential V_rest is the unique fixed point. To determine if this fixed point is stable (attracting), we examine the derivative of f at V*:</Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
f(V) = -(V - V_rest) / tau
f'(V) = -1/tau

Since tau &gt; 0, we have f'(V*) = -1/tau &lt; 0
  </Code>

  <Body>A negative derivative indicates stability: perturbations decay exponentially. The magnitude |f'(V*)| = 1/tau determines the rate of convergence, with time constant tau.</Body>

  <H2>Attractive Basins and Initial Conditions</H2>

  <Body>The basin of attraction (or attractive basin) of an attractor is the set of all initial conditions whose trajectories converge to that attractor. Understanding basins is crucial because it tells us which states lead to which long-term behaviors.</Body>

  <Body>For a globally attracting fixed point like the resting potential in the passive membrane equation, the basin of attraction is the entire state space. Every initial voltage eventually returns to rest.</Body>

  <Body>However, many neuronal systems have multiple attractors with distinct basins. For example:</Body>

  <Body>1. A neuron with bistable dynamics might have two stable fixed points (resting and depolarized), each with its own basin.</Body>

  <Body>2. Near a firing threshold, initial conditions on one side lead to rest, while those on the other side lead to a spike (or sustained oscillation).</Body>

  <Body>3. The boundary between basins (the separatrix) determines the effective threshold for neuronal responses.</Body>

  <Code lang="python">
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Example: 1D system with multiple fixed points
# dx/dt = x - x^3 (has fixed points at x = -1, 0, +1)

def bistable_dynamics(x):
    return x - x**3

x_range = np.linspace(-1.5, 1.5, 100)
dxdt = bistable_dynamics(x_range)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(x_range, dxdt, 'b-', linewidth=2)
plt.axhline(y=0, color='k', linestyle='-')

  </Code>

    <Back>The set of all initial conditions whose trajectories converge to a particular attractor. It defines which starting states lead to which long-term behavior.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Biological Interpretation: Resting Potential as Attractor</H2>

  <Body>The resting membrane potential of a neuron provides a perfect biological example of a stable fixed point attractor. At rest, the membrane voltage settles to approximately -70 mV (varying by neuron type) due to the balance of ionic currents.</Body>

  <Body>The passive membrane equation captures this behavior:</Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
C * dV/dt = -g_L * (V - V_rest) + I_ext

where:
C = membrane capacitance
g_L = leak conductance
V_rest = reversal potential for leak current
I_ext = external input current
  </Code>

  <Body>In the absence of external input (I_ext = 0), this simplifies to our canonical form with time constant tau = C/g_L. The resting potential V_rest is a globally stable fixed point: any perturbation (such as a brief synaptic input) causes the voltage to deviate, but it returns exponentially to rest.</Body>

  <Body>This dynamical systems perspective illuminates several biological phenomena:</Body>

  <Body>1. RETURN TO REST: After subthreshold synaptic input, the membrane voltage returns to V_rest with time constant tau. This is trajectory convergence to the fixed point attractor.</Body>

  <Body>2. TIME CONSTANT: The membrane time constant tau = C/g_L determines how quickly the neuron responds. Larger capacitance means slower responses (more charge needed); larger conductance means faster responses (current flows more easily).</Body>

  <Body>3. THRESHOLD BEHAVIOR: When additional voltage-dependent conductances are included (Na+, K+ channels), the system gains new fixed points and bifurcations, enabling action potential generation.</Body>

  <H2>Phase Portraits and Geometric Analysis</H2>

  <Body>A phase portrait is a geometric representation of a dynamical system showing fixed points, trajectories, and flow direction in state space. For 2D systems, phase portraits provide powerful visual insight into system behavior.</Body>

  <Body>Key elements of a phase portrait include:</Body>

  <Body>1. Fixed points marked as dots (stable: filled, unstable: open)</Body>

  <Body>2. Nullclines: curves where dx/dt = 0 or dy/dt = 0</Body>

  <Body>3. Vector field or flow arrows showing direction of motion</Body>

  <Body>4. Representative trajectories from various initial conditions</Body>

  <Code lang="python">
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 2D linear system approaching a stable node
# dx/dt = -x
# dy/dt = -2y

def linear_2d(state, t):
    x, y = state
    dxdt = -x
    dydt = -2*y
    return [dxdt, dydt]

# Create phase portrait
x_range = np.linspace(-2, 2, 20)
y_range = np.linspace(-2, 2, 20)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x_range, y_range)

# Vector field
U = -X       # dx/dt
V = -2*Y     # dy/dt

# Plot vector field (normalized for visibility)
magnitude = np.sqrt(U**2 + V**2)
U_norm = U / magnitude
V_norm = V / magnitude
plt.quiver(X, Y, U_norm, V_norm, magnitude, cmap='viridis', alpha=0.7)

# Mark the fixed point at origin
plt.plot(0, 0, 'ro', markersize=12, label='Stable fixed point')

# Nullclines

  <Body>For the 2D linear system shown above, both eigenvalues are negative (-1 and -2), making the origin a stable node. All trajectories converge to the origin, with faster decay along the y-direction (eigenvalue -2) than the x-direction (eigenvalue -1).</Body>
