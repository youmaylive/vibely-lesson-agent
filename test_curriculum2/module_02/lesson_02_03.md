# Perturbation Theory: Noise Effects on Stability

## Key Insight
Small noise can qualitatively alter deterministic predictions—stabilizing unstable states, inducing transitions between attractors, and generating coherence resonance—requiring perturbation theory to predict noise-induced phenomena.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply perturbation theory to analyze weak noise effects on fixed points
- Derive noise-induced transition rates using Kramers' formula
- Understand coherence resonance: noise-optimized regularity
- Distinguish parameter regimes where noise is perturbative vs. dominant

## Warmup (Callback)
Deterministic stability (lesson_02_01) assumes no noise; perturbation theory quantifies when noise matters

## Content Outline
- Perturbation expansion: x = x₀ + εx₁ + ε²x₂ + ...
- Weak noise limit: σ → 0 analysis
- Fokker-Planck equation for probability density evolution
- Kramers' escape rate: r ∝ exp(-ΔV/σ²) for barrier crossing
- Coherence resonance: optimal noise level for regular firing
- Stochastic resonance: noise-enhanced signal detection
- Validity limits: when perturbation theory breaks down
- Numerical validation: comparing perturbative predictions with simulations

## Key Concepts
- Perturbation expansion
- Weak noise approximation
- Fokker-Planck equation
- Kramers' rate
- Coherence resonance
- Stochastic resonance

## Practical Examples
- Perturbative correction to fixed point location with weak noise
- Kramers' formula application: escape from potential well
- Coherence resonance in FHN model: CV vs. noise intensity
- Stochastic resonance demonstration: subthreshold signal detection
- Numerical simulation validating perturbative predictions

## Verification Criteria

### Knowledge Check
Students should apply perturbation expansions, compute Kramers' rates, and demonstrate coherence/stochastic resonance numerically

### Success Indicators
- Correctly performs perturbation expansion to first order
- Computes escape rates matching Kramers' formula predictions
- Demonstrates coherence resonance with optimal noise level
- Identifies parameter regimes where perturbation theory fails

### Common Misconceptions
- Assuming perturbation theory applies for arbitrary noise strength
- Neglecting higher-order corrections when necessary
- Confusing coherence resonance with stochastic resonance
- Misapplying Kramers' formula outside weak noise regime
