  <H1>Phase Reduction Theory</H1>

  <Body>Oscillatory neurons near limit cycles can be reduced to a single phase variable, dramatically simplifying analysis while preserving essential synchronization dynamics. This powerful dimensionality reduction technique transforms high-dimensional neuronal models into tractable one-dimensional phase equations, enabling rigorous analysis of network synchronization phenomena.</Body>

  <Body>In previous lessons, you studied the FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model and its limit cycle dynamics. While these multi-dimensional systems capture rich biophysical detail, analyzing networks of such oscillators becomes computationally intractable. Phase reduction provides the mathematical framework to distill the essential dynamics into a single variable: the phase θ ∈ [0, 2π).</Body>

  <H2>Limit Cycle Oscillators</H2>

  <Body>A limit cycle is an isolated closed trajectory in phase space to which neighboring trajectories converge (stable limit cycle) or diverge (unstable limit cycle). For neuronal oscillators, stable limit cycles correspond to sustained periodic firing patterns. Mathematically, consider a system of ordinary differential equations:</Body>

  <Code lang="python">
# General form of an autonomous dynamical system
# dx/dt = F(x), where x ∈ R^n

import numpy as np
from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

def fhn_system(t, state, I_ext=0.5, a=0.7, b=0.8, tau=12.5):
    """FitzHugh-Nagumo model exhibiting limit cycle behavior."""
    v, w = state
    dvdt = v - (v**3)/3 - w + I_ext
    dwdt = (v + a - b*w) / tau
    return [dvdt, dwdt]

# Solve to find the limit cycle
t_span = [0, 200]
t_eval = np.linspace(0, 200, 5000)
y0 = [0.0, 0.0]
sol = solve_ivp(fhn_system, t_span, y0, t_eval=t_eval, method='RK45')

# After transients, the trajectory settles onto the limit cycle
v_cycle = sol.y[0, -1000:]  # Last portion on limit cycle
w_cycle = sol.y[1, -1000:]
</Code>

  <Body>A periodic orbit x₀(t) with period T satisfies x₀(t + T) = x₀(t) for all t. The limit cycle is an attractor if all trajectories starting in its neighborhood asymptotically approach it.</Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc1">
    <Front>What is a limit cycle?</Front>
    <Back>An isolated closed trajectory (periodic orbit) in phase space. A stable limit cycle attracts nearby trajectories, while an unstable one repels them. In neurons, stable limit cycles correspond to sustained oscillatory firing.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Phase Variable Definition</H2>

  <Body>The phase variable θ ∈ [0, 2π) parameterizes position along the limit cycle. We define θ such that it increases uniformly in time on the unperturbed limit cycle:</Body>

  <Code lang="python">
# On the limit cycle, phase evolves as:
# dθ/dt = ω = 2π/T
# where T is the natural period of oscillation

def compute_natural_frequency(period):
    """Natural angular frequency from period."""
    return 2 * np.pi / period

# For FHN with I_ext=0.5, typical period ≈ 20 time units
T = 20.0  # approximate period
omega = compute_natural_frequency(T)
print(f"Natural frequency ω = {omega:.4f} rad/time unit")
</Code>

  <Body>The phase θ = 0 is conventionally assigned to a specific point on the limit cycle, often the maximum of the membrane potential (spike peak) or threshold crossing. Any point on the limit cycle corresponds to a unique phase value.</Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc2">
    <Front>How does phase evolve on an unperturbed limit cycle?</Front>
    <Back>Phase increases uniformly: dθ/dt = ω = 2π/T, where T is the natural oscillation period. This means phase advances at a constant rate, independent of the specific location on the cycle.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Isochrons: Surfaces of Constant Phase</H2>

  <Body>The concept of phase can be extended beyond the limit cycle itself through isochrons. An isochron is a surface (or curve in 2D) in state space consisting of all points that have the same asymptotic phase—that is, all initial conditions that would reach the same point on the limit cycle at the same time as they converge to it.</Body>

  <Code lang="python">
def compute_isochron_backward(fhn_system, limit_cycle_point, phase,
                               T_backward=100, dt=0.01):

    """
    from scipy.integrate import solve_ivp

    def fhn_backward(t, state):

    t_span = [0, T_backward]
    sol = solve_ivp(fhn_backward, t_span, limit_cycle_point,
                    max_step=dt, method='RK45')

    # The trajectory traces out points on the isochron
    return sol.y[0], sol.y[1]  # v, w coordinates along isochron

# Isochrons foliate the basin of attraction
# Points on the same isochron have identical phase
</Code>

  <Body>Isochrons foliate the basin of attraction of the limit cycle—every point in the basin lies on exactly one isochron. Mathematically, the phase function Θ(x) satisfies ∇Θ · F(x) = ω throughout the basin, where F is the vector field defining the dynamics.</Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc3">
    <Front>What is an isochron?</Front>
    <Back>An isochron is a surface of constant asymptotic phase in state space. All points on an isochron converge to the limit cycle and reach the same phase simultaneously. Isochrons foliate the basin of attraction, assigning a unique phase to every point near the limit cycle.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Phase Response Curve (PRC)</H2>

  <Body>The phase response curve (PRC), denoted Z(θ), quantifies how a brief perturbation shifts the phase of an oscillator depending on when the perturbation is applied. If an infinitesimal perturbation ε is applied at phase θ, the resulting phase shift is:</Body>

  <Body>Δθ = εZ(θ)</Body>

  <Body>The PRC is fundamental to understanding synchronization because it determines how oscillators respond to inputs from other neurons or external stimuli.</Body>

    <Front>What does the Phase Response Curve (PRC) measure?</Front>

  <H2>Type I vs. Type II PRCs</H2>

  <Body>PRCs are classified into two fundamental types based on their shape, which directly relates to the bifurcation structure underlying the oscillation:</Body>

  <H3>Type I PRC (SNIC Bifurcation)</H3>
  <Body>Type I PRCs are strictly non-negative (or non-positive for inhibition). They arise from saddle-node on invariant circle (SNIC) bifurcations, where oscillations emerge as a saddle-node pair annihilates on a limit cycle. The canonical example is the theta neuron model.</Body>

    return theta, prc_type1

# - Always positive (excitation only advances phase)
# - Peak sensitivity near θ = π (late in cycle)
# - Neurons can synchronize but only through phase advancement
</Code>

  <H3>Type II PRC (Hopf Bifurcation)</H3>
  <Body>Type II PRCs are biphasic, with both positive and negative regions. They arise from Hopf bifurcations, where oscillations emerge as a fixed point loses stability. The FHN model near Hopf bifurcation exhibits Type II PRC.</Body>

  <Code lang="python">
def hopf_model_prc():

# - Can advance OR delay phase depending on timing
# - Enables both synchronization and desynchronization

</Code>

  <FlashCard id="fc5">
    <Front>What distinguishes Type I from Type II PRCs?</Front>
    <Back>Type I PRCs (from SNIC bifurcations) are strictly non-negative—perturbations can only advance phase. Type II PRCs (from Hopf bifurcations) are biphasic with positive and negative regions—perturbations can either advance or delay phase depending on timing. This fundamentally affects synchronization properties.</Back>

  <H2>Weak Coupling and Phase Dynamics</H2>

  <Body>Phase reduction is valid under the weak coupling assumption: perturbations must be small compared to the limit cycle dynamics. Under this assumption, the phase dynamics of a single oscillator receiving input I(t) reduce to:</Body>

  <Body>dθ/dt = ω + εZ(θ)I(t)</Body>

  <Body>where ω is the natural frequency, ε is a small coupling parameter, Z(θ) is the PRC, and I(t) is the input signal.</Body>

</Code>

  <FlashCard id="fc6">
    <Front>What is the weak coupling assumption in phase reduction?</Front>
    <Back>The weak coupling assumption requires that perturbations (coupling, inputs) are small compared to the intrinsic limit cycle dynamics. Mathematically, coupling strength ε must satisfy ε &lt;&lt; 1. When violated, higher-order terms become significant and the phase reduction loses accuracy.</Back>

  <H2>Phase Reduction for Coupled Oscillators</H2>

  <H2>Summary</H2>

  <Body>Phase reduction transforms complex, high-dimensional oscillator dynamics into tractable one-dimensional phase equations. Key elements include: (1) the phase variable θ parameterizing position on the limit cycle, (2) isochrons extending phase throughout the basin of attraction, (3) the phase response curve Z(θ) quantifying sensitivity to perturbations, and (4) the weak coupling assumption enabling the reduction. Type I and Type II PRCs, arising from SNIC and Hopf bifurcations respectively, predict qualitatively different synchronization behaviors in neural networks.</Body>
