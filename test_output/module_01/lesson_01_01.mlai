  <H1>Dynamical Systems Framework for Neuroscience</H1>

  <Body>
    Neurons are fundamentally dynamical systems—their membrane potential, ion channel states, and firing patterns evolve continuously through time according to deterministic or stochastic rules. By adopting the mathematical framework of dynamical systems theory, we gain powerful tools for understanding how neurons process information, respond to stimuli, and maintain stable resting states.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    In this lesson, we will develop the core mathematical machinery of dynamical systems and apply it directly to neuronal modeling. You will learn to think of neuronal behavior as trajectories through an abstract state space, and understand how concepts like attractors and basins of attraction explain fundamental neural phenomena such as the resting potential.
  </Body>

  <H2>Mathematical Definition of Dynamical Systems</H2>

  <Body>
    A dynamical system is a mathematical description of how a system's state evolves over time. In the continuous-time setting most relevant to neuroscience, we describe this evolution using ordinary differential equations (ODEs).
  </Body>

  <Body>
    The general form of a continuous-time dynamical system is:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
dx/dt = f(x, t)

where:
- x ∈ ℝⁿ is the state vector (n-dimensional)
- t ∈ ℝ is time
- f: ℝⁿ × ℝ → ℝⁿ is the vector field defining the dynamics
  </Code>

  <Body>
    When the vector field f does not explicitly depend on time (i.e., f(x, t) = f(x)), we call the system autonomous. Most neuronal models are autonomous, though time-varying inputs can make them non-autonomous.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    For a single neuron, the state vector x might include the membrane potential V, gating variables for ion channels (m, h, n in the Hodgkin-Huxley model), intracellular calcium concentration, and other biophysical quantities.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc1">
    <Front>What is a dynamical system in mathematical terms?</Front>
    <Back>A dynamical system is described by dx/dt = f(x, t), where x is the state vector, t is time, and f is the vector field that determines how the state evolves. When f doesn't explicitly depend on t, the system is called autonomous.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>State Space and Trajectories</H2>

  <Body>
    The state space (or phase space) is the n-dimensional space containing all possible states of the system. Each point in state space represents a complete snapshot of the system at some instant. For a neuron modeled by membrane potential V alone, the state space is the real line ℝ. For the Hodgkin-Huxley model with four state variables, the state space is ℝ⁴.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    A trajectory (or orbit) is the path traced by the state as the system evolves through time. Given an initial condition x(t₀) = x₀, the trajectory is the solution x(t) for t ≥ t₀. The uniqueness theorem for ODEs guarantees that trajectories cannot cross in state space for autonomous systems—this geometric constraint is fundamental to qualitative analysis.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    The code above demonstrates a fundamental property of neuronal dynamics: regardless of the initial membrane potential, the system evolves toward the resting potential V_rest. This is our first example of an attractor.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc2">
    <Front>What is a trajectory in dynamical systems theory?</Front>
    <Back>A trajectory (or orbit) is the path traced through state space by the system's state as it evolves in time. Given initial condition x₀, the trajectory is the solution x(t) of the differential equation. For autonomous systems, trajectories cannot cross in state space due to the uniqueness theorem for ODEs.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Deterministic vs. Stochastic Dynamical Systems</H2>

  <Body>
    The dynamical systems we've discussed so far are deterministic: given precise initial conditions, the future evolution is completely determined. However, real neurons are subject to various sources of noise:
  </Body>

  <Body>
    • Channel noise: Random opening and closing of ion channels (especially important in small neurons or axons)
    • Synaptic noise: Stochastic neurotransmitter release
    • Thermal fluctuations: Random molecular motion affecting membrane properties
    • Network noise: Irregular inputs from presynaptic neurons
  </Body>

  <Body>
    When noise is significant, we transition from ordinary differential equations to stochastic differential equations (SDEs):
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
dx = f(x, t)dt + σ(x, t)dW

where:
- dW is a Wiener process (Brownian motion) increment
- σ(x, t) is the noise intensity (can be state-dependent)
  </Code>

  <Body>
    The key insight is that noise doesn't simply "blur" deterministic dynamics—it can qualitatively change system behavior. For example, noise can cause spontaneous transitions between different attractors, a phenomenon impossible in deterministic systems.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc3">
    <Front>What distinguishes stochastic from deterministic dynamical systems?</Front>
    <Back>Deterministic systems have future states completely determined by initial conditions (dx/dt = f(x,t)). Stochastic systems include random noise terms (dx = f(x,t)dt + σ(x,t)dW), making future states probabilistic. Noise can qualitatively change behavior, enabling spontaneous transitions between attractors.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Attractors: Where Trajectories Go</H2>

  <Body>
    An attractor is a set of states toward which trajectories converge as time approaches infinity. Attractors represent the long-term behavior of the system and are central to understanding neuronal dynamics. There are several types:
  </Body>

  <H3>Fixed Point Attractors</H3>

  <Body>
    A fixed point (or equilibrium point) x* satisfies f(x*) = 0. At a fixed point, the state doesn't change. A fixed point is an attractor if nearby trajectories converge to it. For the passive membrane equation dV/dt = -(V - V_rest)/τ, the fixed point is V* = V_rest, and it's attracting because trajectories from any initial condition converge to it exponentially.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Mathematically, we classify fixed point stability by linearizing around x* and examining eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix J = ∂f/∂x evaluated at x*:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
For 1D systems:
- If f'(x*) &lt; 0, the fixed point is stable (attracting)
- If f'(x*) &gt; 0, the fixed point is unstable (repelling)

For nD systems:
- All eigenvalues with negative real parts → stable
- Any eigenvalue with positive real part → unstable
  </Code>

  <H3>Limit Cycle Attractors</H3>

  <Body>
    A limit cycle is a closed, isolated trajectory in state space. Systems with limit cycle attractors exhibit periodic oscillations—trajectories starting near the limit cycle spiral toward it. Many neurons exhibit repetitive firing, which can be modeled as limit cycles. The period of the limit cycle corresponds to the interspike interval.
  </Body>

  <H3>Strange Attractors</H3>

  <Body>
    Strange attractors have fractal structure and are associated with chaotic dynamics. While less common in single-neuron models, chaotic dynamics can emerge in neural networks and in certain conductance-based models under specific parameter regimes. Strange attractors have sensitive dependence on initial conditions—nearby trajectories diverge exponentially.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc4">
    <Front>What are the three main types of attractors in dynamical systems?</Front>
    <Back>1) Fixed point attractors: Single states where trajectories converge (e.g., resting potential). 2) Limit cycle attractors: Closed periodic orbits representing sustained oscillations (e.g., repetitive firing). 3) Strange attractors: Fractal structures associated with chaos and sensitive dependence on initial conditions (rare in single neurons, possible in networks).</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Basins of Attraction</H2>

  <Body>
    The basin of attraction of an attractor A is the set of all initial conditions whose trajectories converge to A. Understanding basins is crucial because they determine which attractor the system reaches from any given starting point.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    For the simple passive membrane model, the basin of attraction for the resting potential V_rest is the entire real line—every initial membrane potential leads to V_rest. However, more complex neuronal models can have multiple attractors with distinct basins.

  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc5">
    <Front>What is a basin of attraction?</Front>
    <Back>The basin of attraction of an attractor A is the set of all initial conditions whose trajectories converge to A as t → ∞. Basins determine which attractor the system reaches from any starting point. In systems with multiple attractors, basins are separated by boundaries called separatrices, which often contain unstable fixed points.</Back>

  <H2>Biological Interpretation: Resting Potential as a Fixed Point Attractor</H2>

  <Body>
    The resting membrane potential of a neuron provides an elegant example of a fixed point attractor. At rest, the membrane potential remains stable around -65 to -70 mV because of the balance between:
  </Body>

  <Body>
    • Potassium leak currents (tending to hyperpolarize)
    • Sodium leak currents (tending to depolarize)
    • Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pump activity (maintaining ion gradients)
  </Body>

  <Body>
    When a neuron is perturbed from rest (by synaptic input or experimental current injection), it returns to the resting potential. This is precisely the behavior of an attracting fixed point. The time constant τ = RC of the membrane determines how quickly this return occurs.
  </Body>

  <Code lang="python">
# Analytical solution for passive membrane
def analytical_solution(t, V0, V_rest, tau):
    """
    Solution to dV/dt = -(V - V_rest)/tau

    V(t) = V_rest + (V0 - V_rest) * exp(-t/tau)

# Demonstrate exponential convergence

t = np.linspace(0, 50, 100)
V = analytical_solution(t, V0, V_rest, tau)

# Calculate characteristic times
t_37 = tau  # Time to decay to 37% of initial deviation
t_95 = 3 * tau  # Time to reach ~95% of final value

print(f"Resting potential: {V_rest} mV")
print(f"Time constant τ: {tau} ms")
print(f"After 1τ ({t_37} ms): V = {analytical_solution(t_37, V0, V_rest, tau):.2f} mV")
print(f"After 3τ ({t_95} ms): V = {analytical_solution(t_95, V0, V_rest, tau):.2f} mV")
  </Code>

  <Body>
    The analytical solution V(t) = V_rest + (V₀ - V_rest)·exp(-t/τ) shows that the membrane potential approaches V_rest exponentially. After one time constant τ, the deviation from rest has decayed to 37% of its initial value. After 3τ, the system is within 5% of equilibrium.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc6">
    <Front>Why is the neuronal resting potential an example of a fixed point attractor?</Front>
    <Back>At the resting potential, ionic currents balance (f(V_rest) = 0), making it a fixed point. It's attracting because any perturbation causes the membrane potential to return exponentially to rest. The linearized dynamics give dV/dt ≈ -(V - V_rest)/τ with solution V(t) = V_rest + (V₀ - V_rest)e^(-t/τ), showing convergence with time constant τ.</Back>

    In the FitzHugh-Nagumo phase portrait above, the red V-nullcline (cubic) and blue W-nullcline (linear) intersect at fixed points. Depending on parameters, the system can exhibit a stable fixed point (quiescence), a stable limit cycle (repetitive firing), or excitable dynamics (single spike in response to perturbation). This geometric approach reveals how qualitative behavior changes with parameters—the mathematical foundation of bifurcation theory.
  </Body>

  <H2>Summary</H2>

  <Body>
    The dynamical systems framework provides a powerful lens for understanding neuronal behavior:
  </Body>

  <Body>
    • Neurons are dynamical systems whose states evolve according to differential equations
    • The state space contains all possible configurations; trajectories show temporal evolution
    • Deterministic vs. stochastic descriptions depend on whether noise is significant
    • Attractors (fixed points, limit cycles, strange attractors) represent long-term behavior
    • Basins of attraction determine which attractor is reached from each initial condition
    • The resting potential is a fixed point attractor; repetitive firing can be a limit cycle
    • Phase portraits provide geometric insight into system behavior and parameter dependence
  </Body>

  <Body>
    In subsequent lessons, we will build on this foundation to analyze neuronal excitability, bifurcations between resting and firing states, and the dynamics of neural circuits.
