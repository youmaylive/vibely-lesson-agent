  <H1>Bifurcation Theory in Neuronal Excitability</H1>

  <Body>
    Bifurcations mark qualitative transitions in neuronal behavior—from silence to firing, from tonic to bursting—and understanding bifurcation structure reveals how neurons switch between computational modes as parameters vary. In this lesson, we develop a systematic framework for classifying bifurcations in neuronal models and connect them to observable properties like firing rate curves and excitability classes.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Recall from our analysis of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model that Hopf bifurcations introduce transitions to oscillatory behavior. Now we extend this to a comprehensive taxonomy of bifurcations relevant to neuroscience, enabling us to predict how neurons respond to changing inputs, neuromodulation, or pathological conditions.
  </Body>

  <H2>What is a Bifurcation?</H2>

  <Body>
    A bifurcation occurs when a small, smooth change in a system parameter causes a qualitative change in its dynamical behavior. The parameter value at which this transition occurs is called the bifurcation point. Unlike simple parameter sensitivity where behavior changes gradually, bifurcations represent genuine phase transitions in the system's dynamics.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Mathematically, consider a dynamical system dx/dt = f(x, μ) where x is the state variable and μ is a parameter. A bifurcation occurs at μ = μ* if the topological structure of the phase portrait changes—fixed points may appear, disappear, or change stability; limit cycles may be born or destroyed.
  </Body>

  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Saddle-Node Bifurcation</H2>

  <Body>
    The saddle-node bifurcation (also called fold or tangent bifurcation) involves the creation or annihilation of a pair of fixed points—one stable (node) and one unstable (saddle). This is the generic mechanism by which fixed points appear in systems with one parameter.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    The normal form for a saddle-node bifurcation is:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="python">
# Saddle-node normal form: dx/dt = μ + x²
# For μ &lt; 0: two fixed points at x = ±√(-μ)
# For μ = 0: one fixed point at x = 0 (saddle-node)
# For μ &gt; 0: no fixed points

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def saddle_node_fixed_points(mu):
    """Return fixed points for saddle-node normal form."""
    if mu &lt; 0:
        return np.array([np.sqrt(-mu), -np.sqrt(-mu)])
    elif mu == 0:
        return np.array([0])
    else:
        return np.array([])  # No real fixed points

# Bifurcation diagram
mu_values = np.linspace(-1, 0.5, 200)
stable_branch = []
unstable_branch = []

for mu in mu_values:
    if mu &lt;= 0:
        stable_branch.append(-np.sqrt(-mu))    # Stable node
        unstable_branch.append(np.sqrt(-mu))   # Saddle
    else:
        stable_branch.append(np.nan)
        unstable_branch.append(np.nan)
  </Code>

  <Body>
    In neuronal models, saddle-node bifurcations often correspond to the appearance of a firing threshold. Below the bifurcation, the neuron has a stable resting state; at the bifurcation point, this rest state collides with an unstable threshold and both disappear, forcing the neuron to fire.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc2">
    <Front>What happens at a saddle-node bifurcation?</Front>
    <Back>A stable fixed point (node) and an unstable fixed point (saddle) collide and annihilate each other, or conversely, a pair of fixed points is created from nothing.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Hopf Bifurcation</H2>

  <Body>
    The Hopf bifurcation marks the birth (or death) of a limit cycle from a fixed point. As a parameter varies, a pair of complex conjugate eigenvalues crosses the imaginary axis, and the fixed point changes stability while spawning oscillations.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    The key signature is in the eigenvalues λ = α(μ) ± iω(μ). At the Hopf bifurcation:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="python">
# Hopf bifurcation conditions:
# 1. α(μ*) = 0 (real part crosses zero)
# 2. ω(μ*) ≠ 0 (nonzero imaginary part - oscillations)
# 3. dα/dμ ≠ 0 (transversality condition)

    dxdt = mu * x - omega * y_coord - x * r_sq
    dydt = omega * x + mu * y_coord - y_coord * r_sq

    return [dxdt, dydt]

# For mu &lt; 0: stable fixed point at origin
# For mu &gt; 0: unstable origin surrounded by stable limit cycle
#            with radius r = √μ
  </Code>

  <Body>
    There are two types of Hopf bifurcations:
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Supercritical Hopf: A stable limit cycle is born from a stable fixed point, which becomes unstable. The amplitude grows continuously from zero as √(μ - μ*). This produces a "soft" onset of oscillations.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Subcritical Hopf: An unstable limit cycle shrinks and disappears into a stable fixed point, which becomes unstable. Beyond the bifurcation, the system jumps to a distant attractor. This can produce hysteresis and "hard" onset of oscillations.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc3">
    <Front>What distinguishes supercritical from subcritical Hopf bifurcation?</Front>
    <Back>Supercritical: stable limit cycle born, amplitude grows smoothly from zero. Subcritical: unstable limit cycle disappears, system jumps to distant attractor, exhibiting hysteresis.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Saddle-Node on Invariant Circle (SNIC)</H2>

  <Body>
    The SNIC bifurcation (also called SNIPER - Saddle-Node Infinite PERiod) combines features of saddle-node and oscillatory dynamics. Here, a saddle-node bifurcation occurs on an invariant circle (limit cycle), creating a global bifurcation.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    The key property of SNIC is that the period of oscillations diverges as the bifurcation is approached: T → ∞ as μ → μ*, which means the frequency f → 0 continuously. This produces a continuous frequency-current (f-I) curve starting from arbitrarily low frequencies.
  </Body>

  <Code lang="python">

  <H2>Neuronal Excitability Classes</H2>

  <Body>
    The bifurcation type at firing onset determines the neuron's excitability class, first characterized by Hodgkin in 1948:
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Type I Excitability (Integrators): Firing onset via SNIC bifurcation. These neurons can fire at arbitrarily low frequencies near threshold, producing a continuous f-I curve. They act as integrators, responding to the mean level of input. The theta neuron and quadratic integrate-and-fire models exhibit Type I excitability.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Type II Excitability (Resonators): Firing onset via Hopf bifurcation. These neurons have a minimum firing frequency—they jump from silence to finite-frequency oscillations. They act as resonators, responding preferentially to inputs near their natural frequency. The Hodgkin-Huxley squid axon model (at standard temperature) exhibits Type II excitability.
  </Body>

  <H2>Continuation Methods and Bifurcation Diagrams</H2>

  <Body>
    Numerical continuation is a technique for systematically tracking how fixed points, limit cycles, and their stability change as parameters vary. Rather than running many simulations, continuation methods follow solution branches through parameter space, detecting bifurcations where branches appear, disappear, or change stability.

  <Body>
    Professional continuation software like AUTO, PyDSTool, or MATCONT can track bifurcations in high-dimensional systems, follow limit cycles, detect period-doubling cascades, and compute two-parameter bifurcation diagrams. These tools are essential for analyzing conductance-based models like Hodgkin-Huxley.

  <H2>Bifurcation Diagram for the Hodgkin-Huxley Model</H2>

  <Body>
    The Hodgkin-Huxley model exhibits rich bifurcation structure as applied current I varies. At low current, a stable resting potential exists. As I increases, this rest state loses stability via a subcritical Hopf bifurcation, and the system jumps to repetitive firing. This explains the Type II excitability of the squid giant axon.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    The full bifurcation diagram reveals:
  </Body>

  <Body>
    1. A stable equilibrium branch at low I (resting state)
  </Body>

  <Body>
    2. An unstable limit cycle branch emerging from a subcritical Hopf bifurcation
  </Body>

  <Body>
    3. A stable limit cycle branch (repetitive firing) that coexists with the rest state in a bistable region
  </Body>

  <Body>
    4. A saddle-node of limit cycles where unstable and stable oscillations collide
  </Body>

  <Body>
    The subcritical nature produces hysteresis: the current needed to initiate firing differs from the current at which firing stops.
  </Body>

  <H2>Summary: Relating Bifurcations to Neural Computation</H2>

  <Body>
    Understanding bifurcation structure is essential for predicting how neurons process information:
  </Body>

  <Body>
    SNIC bifurcations create integrator neurons ideal for rate coding and detecting input magnitude.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Hopf bifurcations create resonator neurons suited for detecting oscillatory input and supporting synchronization.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Subcritical bifurcations introduce bistability and hysteresis, enabling memory and switching behaviors.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Bifurcation diagrams map the complete repertoire of behaviors available to a neuron as conditions change.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Neuromodulators can shift neurons between excitability classes by changing the underlying bifurcation structure, fundamentally altering their computational properties.
