  <H1>Cable Theory: Passive Signal Propagation</H1>

  <Body>
    In previous lessons, we treated neurons as point models where voltage is uniform throughout the cell. Real neurons, however, have elaborate dendritic trees where synaptic inputs occur at varying distances from the soma. Cable theory provides the mathematical framework for understanding how electrical signals propagate passively through these extended neuronal structures.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    The cable equation reveals how dendritic geometry—diameter, length, and branching patterns—fundamentally shapes synaptic integration by determining how signals attenuate and summate across space and time. This lesson develops cable theory from first principles and explores its profound implications for neural computation.
  </Body>

  <H2>The Cylindrical Dendrite Model</H2>

  <Body>
    We model a dendrite as a cylindrical cable with uniform properties. The key parameters are the membrane resistance per unit length r_m (Ω·cm), axial (cytoplasmic) resistance per unit length r_a (Ω/cm), and membrane capacitance per unit length c_m (F/cm). Current can flow in two ways: axially along the cytoplasm, and radially across the membrane.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Consider a small segment of cable at position x with length Δx. The axial current I_a flows along the dendrite, while the membrane current I_m crosses the membrane. By Ohm's law, the axial current is driven by the voltage gradient:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
I_a = -(1/r_a) · ∂V/∂x
  </Code>

  <Body>
    The negative sign indicates that current flows from high to low voltage. The membrane current per unit length has two components: capacitive current and ionic (resistive) current:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
i_m = c_m · ∂V/∂t + V/r_m
  </Code>

  <FlashCard id="fc1">
    <Front>What is axial resistance (r_a) in cable theory?</Front>
    <Back>Axial resistance is the resistance to current flow along the cytoplasm inside a dendrite, measured in Ω/cm. It depends on cytoplasmic resistivity and the cross-sectional area of the dendrite.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <FlashCard id="fc2">
    <Front>What is membrane resistance (r_m) in cable theory?</Front>
    <Back>Membrane resistance is the resistance to current flow across the membrane per unit length, measured in Ω·cm. Higher r_m means less current leaks out of the cable, allowing signals to travel farther.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Derivation of the Cable Equation</H2>

  <Body>
    Current conservation requires that any change in axial current along x must equal the membrane current leaving at that location:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
-∂I_a/∂x = i_m
  </Code>

  <Body>
    Substituting our expressions for I_a and i_m:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
(1/r_a) · ∂²V/∂x² = c_m · ∂V/∂t + V/r_m
  </Code>

  <Body>
    Multiplying both sides by r_m and defining the space constant λ = √(r_m/r_a) and time constant τ = r_m · c_m, we obtain the canonical cable equation:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
λ² · ∂²V/∂x² = τ · ∂V/∂t + V
  </Code>

  <Body>
    This is a linear partial differential equation (PDE) that describes how voltage evolves in both space and time. The two fundamental constants λ and τ completely characterize the cable's electrical properties.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc3">
    <Front>What is the space constant λ and what does it represent physically?</Front>
    <Back>The space constant λ = √(r_m/r_a) has units of length (cm). It represents the distance over which a steady-state voltage decays to 1/e (≈37%) of its original value. Larger λ means signals travel farther before attenuating.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <FlashCard id="fc4">
    <Front>What is the time constant τ in cable theory?</Front>
    <Back>The time constant τ = r_m · c_m has units of time (seconds). It characterizes how quickly the membrane voltage responds to changes—the time for voltage to reach (1 - 1/e) ≈ 63% of its final value during charging, or decay to 1/e during discharging.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Steady-State Solution: Exponential Decay</H2>

  <Body>
    In steady state (∂V/∂t = 0), the cable equation simplifies to an ordinary differential equation:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
λ² · d²V/dx² = V
  </Code>

  <Body>
    This has the general solution V(x) = A·exp(x/λ) + B·exp(-x/λ). For a semi-infinite cable extending from x = 0 to infinity with voltage V₀ applied at x = 0, we require the solution to remain bounded as x → ∞, giving:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
V(x) = V₀ · exp(-x/λ)
  </Code>

  <Body>
    This exponential decay is the hallmark of passive signal propagation. At x = λ, the voltage has decayed to V₀/e ≈ 0.37V₀. At x = 3λ, it has decayed to about 5% of the original value.
  </Body>

  <H3>Python Implementation: Steady-State Voltage Profile</H3>

  <H2>Space Constant: Dependence on Morphology</H2>

  <Body>
    The space constant λ = √(r_m/r_a) depends critically on dendritic diameter. For a cylindrical cable with diameter d, membrane resistance per unit length r_m and axial resistance per unit length r_a relate to the specific resistivities as:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
r_m = R_m / (π·d)      [Ω·cm]
r_a = 4·R_a / (π·d²)   [Ω/cm]

where:
R_m = specific membrane resistance (Ω·cm²)
R_a = axial (cytoplasmic) resistivity (Ω·cm)
  </Code>

  <Body>
    Substituting into the expression for λ:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
λ = √(r_m/r_a) = √[(R_m·π·d²) / (4·R_a·π·d)] = √(R_m·d / 4R_a) = (1/2)·√(R_m·d/R_a)
  </Code>

  <Body>
    This reveals that λ ∝ √d: thicker dendrites have larger space constants. This has profound implications—large-diameter dendrites (like the apical dendrite of pyramidal neurons) conduct signals more effectively than thin distal branches.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc5">
    <Front>How does dendritic diameter affect the space constant λ?</Front>
    <Back>The space constant scales as λ ∝ √d, where d is the diameter. Thicker dendrites have larger space constants, meaning signals attenuate less and travel farther before decaying. This is why proximal dendrites are typically thicker than distal branches.</Back>

print(f"Ratio: {lambda_thick/lambda_thin:.2f}")
  </Code>

  <Body>
    For typical cortical neurons with R_m ≈ 20,000 Ω·cm² and R_a ≈ 150 Ω·cm, a 5 μm diameter dendrite has λ ≈ 400 μm, while a 0.5 μm diameter dendrite has λ ≈ 130 μm. The 10× difference in diameter produces only a √10 ≈ 3.2× difference in λ.
  </Body>

  <H2>Electrotonic Distance</H2>

  <Body>
    Electrotonic distance X = x/λ is a dimensionless measure that normalizes physical distance by the space constant. This allows comparison across dendrites with different morphologies. At X = 1 (one electrotonic length unit), voltage has decayed to 37% of its original value; at X = 3, it's down to 5%.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Electrotonic distance is crucial for understanding synaptic efficacy. Two synapses at the same physical distance from the soma may have very different effects if they're located on dendrites with different space constants.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc6">
    <Front>What is electrotonic distance and why is it useful?</Front>
    <Back>Electrotonic distance X = x/λ is a dimensionless measure that normalizes physical distance by the space constant. It allows meaningful comparison of signal attenuation across different dendritic branches with varying morphologies. At X = 1, voltage is at 37% of its initial value.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Transient Solutions and the Time Constant</H2>

  <Body>
    For time-varying inputs, we must solve the full cable equation. The solution can be constructed using Green's functions. For a point current injection I₀·δ(x)·δ(t) at the origin at time zero, the Green's function (response kernel) is:
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
G(x,t) = (r_m / 2λ) · (1/√(πt/τ)) · exp(-t/τ) · exp(-x²·τ/(4λ²t))
  </Code>

  <Body>
    This shows that the voltage spreads out in space as a Gaussian that broadens with time, while simultaneously decaying exponentially with time constant τ. The interplay between spatial spread (governed by λ) and temporal decay (governed by τ) determines the effective integration window for synaptic inputs.
  </Body>

  <H3>Finite Difference Solution</H3>

  <Body>
    For numerical solutions, we discretize the cable equation using finite differences. Let V_i^n denote the voltage at spatial node i and time step n:

  <H2>Boundary Conditions</H2>

  <Body>
    The solution to the cable equation depends critically on boundary conditions. Three common types are:
  </Body>

  <Body>
    1. **Sealed-end (Neumann)**: No current flows through the end: ∂V/∂x = 0. This models a dendrite terminal or sealed electrode.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    2. **Killed-end (Dirichlet)**: The end is held at resting potential: V = 0. This models a very low-resistance connection (voltage clamp) or a massive soma.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    3. **Semi-infinite**: The cable extends to infinity: V → 0 as x → ∞. This is an idealization useful for analytical solutions.
  </Body>

  <Body>
    Sealed ends cause voltage reflection—the signal effectively doubles at the boundary. Killed ends cause signal absorption. Real dendritic trees have complex boundary conditions due to branching and soma impedance.
  </Body>

  <FlashCard id="fc7">
    <Front>What is a sealed-end boundary condition and how does it affect signal propagation?</Front>
    <Back>A sealed-end boundary condition (∂V/∂x = 0) means no axial current flows through the end. This causes voltage reflection—the signal amplitude effectively doubles at the boundary. It models dendritic terminals or the sealed end of a recording electrode.</Back>
  </FlashCard>

  <H2>Synaptic Integration: Location Matters</H2>

  <Body>
    Cable theory explains why synaptic location profoundly affects integration. Distal synapses are electrotonically distant from the soma, so their signals attenuate more before reaching the spike initiation zone. However, this doesn't mean distal synapses are ineffective—the local voltage change at a distal synapse can be much larger than at a proximal synapse for the same conductance change, because the local input resistance is higher.

    The analysis shows that a synapse at 1000 μm (electrotonic distance X = 2.5 for λ = 400 μm) delivers only about 8% of its local effect to the soma, compared to 78% for a synapse at 100 μm. This "dendritic democracy" problem is compensated in real neurons through synaptic scaling—distal synapses often have larger conductances.
  </Body>

  <H2>Branching and the Equivalent Cylinder</H2>

  <Body>
    Real dendrites branch extensively. At a branch point, current divides between the daughter branches. The impedance matching at branch points affects signal propagation. The Rall equivalent cylinder model simplifies analysis by showing that branching trees satisfying the "3/2 power rule" (parent diameter³/² = sum of daughter diameters³/²) are electrically equivalent to unbranched cylinders.
  </Body>

  <Code lang="plaintext">
Rall's 3/2 power rule: d_parent^(3/2) = Σ d_daughter^(3/2)

If satisfied: No impedance mismatch at branch points
If violated: Signal reflection/attenuation at branches
  </Code>

  <FlashCard id="fc8">
    <Front>What is Rall's 3/2 power rule for dendritic branching?</Front>
    <Back>Rall's rule states that d_parent^(3/2) = Σ d_daughter^(3/2), where d is the diameter. When this rule is satisfied, there's no impedance mismatch at branch points, and the branched dendrite is electrically equivalent to an unbranched cylinder. Many real dendrites approximately follow this rule.</Back>
