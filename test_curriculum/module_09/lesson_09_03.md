# Neural Manifolds and Dimensionality Reduction

## Key Insight
High-dimensional neural population activity often lies on low-dimensional manifolds, revealing computational structure and enabling dimensionality reduction techniques to uncover latent dynamics underlying behavior and cognition.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply PCA and other dimensionality reduction to neural data
- Identify neural manifolds and their geometric properties
- Use dynamical systems analysis on reduced representations
- Relate manifold structure to behavioral variables and computations

## Warmup (Callback)
Multi-dimensional neuronal models (modules 01-04); population recordings are even higher-dimensional

## Content Outline
- High-dimensional neural recordings: population activity
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): linear dimensionality reduction
- Nonlinear methods: Isomap, LLE, t-SNE, UMAP
- Neural manifolds: low-dimensional subspaces of activity
- Dynamical systems on manifolds: flow analysis
- Behavioral decoding from manifold coordinates
- Manifold geometry: curvature, topology
- Applications: motor cortex, decision-making, memory

## Key Concepts
- Dimensionality reduction
- Neural manifold
- PCA
- Latent dynamics
- Behavioral decoding
- Manifold geometry

## Practical Examples
- PCA on simulated population activity: identifying principal components
- Nonlinear dimensionality reduction: comparing methods on neural data
- Manifold visualization: 2D/3D projections of high-dimensional activity
- Dynamical analysis: flow fields on neural manifolds
- Behavioral decoding: predicting movement from manifold coordinates

## Verification Criteria

### Knowledge Check
Students should apply dimensionality reduction, identify manifolds, and relate to behavior

### Success Indicators
- Correctly applies PCA and nonlinear methods to neural data
- Identifies low-dimensional manifolds in population activity
- Performs dynamical analysis on reduced representations
- Decodes behavioral variables from manifold coordinates

### Common Misconceptions
- Assuming linear methods always suffice for neural data
- Confusing dimensionality reduction with feature selection
- Neglecting to validate manifold structure statistically
- Misinterpreting manifold dimensions as having direct biological meaning
